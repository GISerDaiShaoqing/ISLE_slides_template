## About ISLE

The [International Institute of Spatial Lifecourse Health (ISLE)](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/jp/zh_CN/index.htm) at Wuhan University is a pioneering research center dedicated to the study of spatial health across the human lifecourse. Directed by Professor Jia Peng, a distinguished expert in the field with extensive international experience, ISLE represents a convergence of spatial information and public health disciplines.

ISLE focuses on understanding health risks and determinants at various stages of life, from infancy to old age, using an array of methodologies and technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, artificial intelligence, statistical analysis, and big data. The institute is at the forefront of a new interdisciplinary research paradigm that integrates health geography, spatial epidemiology, environmental health, infectious disease prediction and control, and medical resource planning.
