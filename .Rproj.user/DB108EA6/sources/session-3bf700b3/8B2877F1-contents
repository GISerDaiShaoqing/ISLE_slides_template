## About ISLE

The [International Institute of Spatial Lifecourse Health (ISLE)](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/jp/zh_CN/index.htm) at Wuhan University is a pioneering research center dedicated to the study of spatial health across the human lifecourse. Directed by Professor Jia Peng, a distinguished expert in the field with extensive international experience, ISLE represents a convergence of spatial information and public health disciplines.

ISLE focuses on understanding health risks and determinants at various stages of life, from infancy to old age, using an array of methodologies and technologies such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, artificial intelligence, statistical analysis, and big data. The institute is at the forefront of a new interdisciplinary research paradigm that integrates health geography, spatial epidemiology, environmental health, infectious disease prediction and control, and medical resource planning.

One of the key initiatives of ISLE is the development of the "Spatial Lifecourse Epidemiology" approach, which leverages advanced technologies to accurately track individual exposure histories and simulate health outcomes over the long term. This innovative approach allows for a granular analysis of disease occurrence and prevalence, as well as the identification of risk factors, enabling more precise health management strategies throughout an individual's life.

ISLE has established several regional cohort studies, including those focusing on natural populations, children, the elderly, sub-health populations, and occupational groups. The institute has been actively involved in numerous international and national research projects, contributing significantly to the global understanding of spatial health dynamics.

The institute also plays a crucial role in fostering academic exchange and collaboration. It has organized international symposia on spatial lifecycle health, bringing together experts from various fields to discuss new methodologies and research findings, and to chart the future direction of the field. These events have been instrumental in advancing the scientific community's understanding of the intersection between space and health.

ISLE's work is published in high-impact journals such as Nature Medicine and The Lancet Global Health, reflecting the institute's commitment to excellence in research and its impact on the global stage. The institute's contributions have been recognized with several awards and honors, including the Best Dissertation Award from the American Association of Geographers (AAG) and the Outstanding Young Scholar Award from the International Society for Environmental Research and Public Health.

Under the leadership of Professor Jia Peng, ISLE continues to push the boundaries of spatial health research, offering a model for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation in the service of public health.
